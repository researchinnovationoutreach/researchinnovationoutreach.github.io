Join us at the 2018 NAIS Annual Conference this March 7 \u2013 9, in Atlanta to explore the possibilities of your own leadership journey, whether you lead as a head of school, teacher, trustee, or in multiple roles. Along with other aspects of a changing world and education landscape, the independent school community is faced with shifting mindsets about who leads and how we lead. When NAIS was founded over 50 years ago, the concept of leadership looked remarkedly different than it does today. While many of the building blocks of effective and inspiring leadership remain the same, we now know there are countless styles, personalities, and skills that can help us be authentic, engaged, and innovative leaders whether in the classroom, a board meeting, or as a head of school.\n \nWho is leading our schools is just as important as how they are doing it. Women and people of color remain underrepresented in many top leadership roles in our schools, Millennials are challenging preconceived notions of success, and retirement is in reach for many heads of school. As we prepare ourselves and our students for the future, we must examine who is preparing and refining their leadership skills and what pathways they are taking along the way."},

We share our experiences. \n \nWith lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.\n \nOur communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can\u2019t experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.\n \nAt the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. \n \nWe come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism\u2014about white supremacy\u2014affirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. \n \nWe know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. \n \nWe celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn\u2019t want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations\u2014our art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.\n \nCome home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities\u2014to build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don\u2019t all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  \n \nWe hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017.

As of 2017, nearly 52% of the world\u2019s population are considered Internet users, with tens of millions more joining their ranks each year. Seventy percent of these users are youth, yet 94% of youth in developed countries are routinely online compared to only 30% in the least developed countries.2 But while more than half of the world\u2019s population is online, how connected are we really? What kind of connections are being nurtured in the online space? And how equitable is people\u2019s access to the Internet around the globe? How does this lack of equity impact our ability to connect to others globally?\n\nThe internet doesn\u2019t just connect people; it is present in seemingly every facet of our lives in big and small ways. It is woven into financial transactions, government functions, the way we learn and access information, how we entertain ourselves, and increasingly in things themselves (appliances, transportation devices, even children\u2019s toys). These connections make our lives easier in many ways, but they also make us vulnerable to both natural and man-made challenges (not to mention what should be, could be and actually is done with the data that is collected through these networks). We all hold a variety of ideas about the web\u2019s promises and perils. The goal of the 2018 summer workshop for educators will be to investigate and make sense of these challenges--and opportunities--as a learning community, and to consider how best to examine them with students who are growing up as digital natives.\n\nThroughout the summer workshop, we will focus on the Internet as a global phenomenon. We will include the US in the discussion (especially as a means of understanding our own perspectives and as a point of comparison), but will focus more broadly on global patterns and trends to enrich and expand our understanding beyond the American viewpoint. As a learning community, we will pay special attention to investigating both the benefits and costs of connectivity on a global/societal, community and individual level. We will examine how and why the web affects different groups and people differently, reflecting specifically on how the Internet reduces or increases equity gaps. We\u2019ll consider the ways the Internet makes our lives easier and at what cost.\n----\nGlobal Studies Outreach at Harvard is a collaboration amongst regional and internationally focused centers and programs at Harvard that share a commitment to conduct educational outreach throughout New England and beyond. The primary goal of this collaboration is to help the general public, and especially K-12 teachers and students, better understand the complex world in which we live. We do this by organizing events and programming around global themes and preparing and disseminating resources for classroom use\u2014both of which build on Harvard\u2019s impressive human and material resources. This website will serve as the repository for information regarding this joint programming and an archive for past programming and materials.\n\n\n"},
