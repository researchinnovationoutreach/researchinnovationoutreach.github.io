In the US we have seen a movement away from establishment candidates with the rise of Donald Trump and the success of Bernie Sanders. In Europe, the populist parties, France\u2019s National Front, Britain\u2019s UKIP, Poland\u2019s Law and Justice party, Jobbik in Hungary, Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, and Greece\u2019s SYRIZA (to name a few) have gained in vote share. In Russia, there are various radical right organizations and parties ranging from the Night Wolves nationalist biker gang to Vladimir Zhirinovsky\u2019s LDPR.\n\nVoters have come to rally around the idea of ousting establishment candidates and finding those who appeal to the \u201ceveryday person,\u201d the person who is not afraid to stand-up and voice their opinion.\n\nWhat has led to the success of such parties and candidates in recent years? Is it the economy that has pushed voters more to the extreme sides of the ideological spectrum? Is it a fear of the \u201cother\u201d that is driving the movement? Is this just an aberration that will resolve itself in a few years\u2019 time or is it the new normal?\n\nThe one-day event is designed to consider current electoral trends in Europe and Russia.Teachers will discuss and debate current electoral, economic, and multicultural issues facing Europe and Russia to equip themselves with the tools necessary to teach complicated and controversial subjects in schools and community college settings. Participants will consider how changing demographics affect both national and common European senses of identity and the effects of the economy on electoral outcomes.
