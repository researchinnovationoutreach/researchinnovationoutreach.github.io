Instead of isolation, we wish for connection, cohesion and community, because we know that we are better together than we are apart. Community is essential to education--we learn from one other, we cheer each other on toward success, and we thrive by including others.  This year the VAIS Professional Development Advisory Commission (PDAC) sought proposals that inspire students, teachers, administrators, and schools to connect anew. Sessions should challenge PK-12 teachers and academic administrators to share a variety of models and strategies, skills, resources and tools, opportunities, and ideas that support connectivity and community at all levels. Some potential themes for presentations include, but are not limited to:\nInclusion, in the classroom, school or curricula;\nInnovative technologies connecting students locally and internationally;\nCommunity-building in the classroom, the school and beyond;\nMentoring programs for new teachers and/or younger students;\nIdea-sharing among educators and administrators;\nLeveraging community resources, tangible and intangible\nJoin us and be a part of this amazingly energizing day!

That engagement takes many forms, ranging from organizing protests to developing local partnerships in order to make change in their communities. Young people are searching for more authentic opportunities to get involved, beyond the obligatory community service hours or service learning programs that many schools require of their students.  As teaching and learning evolves to emphasize real-world, impact-driven projects, schools and colleges are searching for ways to engage students in the community in authentic and meaningful ways.  While a good deal of recent activity has been student-led, student civic engagement can be particularly powerful when it is guided by a caring and committed adult or sponsor who can serve as a coach. \n\nWe are partnering with Episcopal High School in Washington D.C. to offer Designing for Student Civic Engagement, a two-day workshop for the adult and student leaders (high school or college-aged) who are working to make change in some capacity, and who would like to learn and practice some skills and frameworks to help guide and organize their work, both with each other and in the community.  Meant for teams made up of 1-2 school leaders who work directly with student leaders AND 2-3 of those student leaders with whom they work, Designing for Student Civic Engagement will provide a boost of effectiveness and purpose as we explore the habits, mindsets, and tools of Design Thinking, particularly as they apply to civic engagement and social change.  Participants will practice strategies for conducting empathy-based research, defining the problem they are hoping to solve, and will learn to collaborate to develop creative solutions alongside members of their community. We\u2019ll also dig into the interpersonal side of civic engagement: what do we do when we experience conflict? How can we better work together as a team?  Teams will return to their school with a new set of tools they can immediately apply in their civic engagement work.\n\nUsing Busboys and Poets as inspirational space and our home base, teams will take a deep dive into a real-world design challenge posed by a community partner, challenging them to dive into the U Street Corridor neighborhood of D.C.  Our design challenge will give student leaders (and those coaching them) a chance to learn and practice some strategies for making connections in a local community, uncovering real human needs, and learning to design solutions with rather than for others.  During our time together, we'll also include opportunities for student and adult/sponsor participants to reflect and discuss the work separately from one another, as students learn to take leadership and sponsors learn to serve as a guide on the side.\n"},

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. \n \nWith lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.\n \nOur communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can\u2019t experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.\n \nAt the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. \n \nWe come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism\u2014about white supremacy\u2014affirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. \n \nWe know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. \n \nWe celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn\u2019t want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations\u2014our art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.\n \nCome home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities\u2014to build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don\u2019t all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  \n \nWe hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017.

Reimagining High School and College Essays\n\u201cEvery essay \u2026creates a working ethos of attempting \u2013 to the utmost \u2013 the improbable.\u201d   \nJoan Retallack\n\nEssay writing is often a struggle for many students, with the transition from high school to college-level expectations proving to be one of the most academically challenging shifts. Expectations for high school papers \u2013 whether the five-paragraph \u201ctheme\u201d or the three-point AP model \u2013 do not, typically, meet traditional standards for college writing.  Questions of audience, various styles of argumentation, the uses of evidence \u2013 and even such basic requirements as a thesis rather than a topic sentence or disciplinary-specific citation-styles \u2013 can radically diverge from what students have been accustomed to in grades 8-12.  How can high school teachers, who often feel as if they are \u201cstraddling the line\u201d between providing the basics of reading comprehension and preparing students for the more complex thinking required by college courses \u2013 help bridge these gaps? \n\nThis year\u2019s annual conference provides teachers and professors with an opportunity to reconsider how the modes of writing that students learn in high school can be utilized in college. In Habits of the Creative Mind (2016), Ann Jurecic and Richard E. Miller propose that \u201cthe best writing is curiosity driven and is carried forward by creative acts of connective thinking.\u201d This kind of writing stands in direct contrast to the more typical \u201crecipe-based approach\u201d that results in formulaic prose. How do we encourage students of all levels to see \u201cwriting as an act of thinking\u201d?\n\nAs Paul Connolly, IWT\u2019s founding director, said in an interview in 1983, \u201cmost students seem to be going through the motion of writing. They're not attached to it. Their writing tends to be perfunctory and it tends to be thoughtless.\" How do we encourage imaginative thinking and the valuing of the writing process, while also fulfilling the demands of standardized testing and state standards? How might writing-based practices for deepening critical analysis better prepare high school students for college? What classroom practices can address such specific needs as, how do we engage students as readers and writers while asking them to conform to the particular demands of form, style, and content?  \n\nThis year\u2019s conference will address these questions from theoretical and practical standpoints.  Together, we will write to explore how the essay is approached in both high school and college; with particular attention to the \u201chigh school essay\u201d that is part of the college application process. We will look to IWT\u2019s signature writing-based teaching practices for new ways to use informal and formal writing to foster community, help students respond productively to intellectual challenges, and smooth the transition from one set of skills to another \u2013 with a minimum anxiety. Finally, we hope this conference day will offer us the chance to be both teachers and writers, remembering the creativity and curiosity that writing provokes.\n "},
