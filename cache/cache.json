The first two of these conferences were held in Worcester, MA in 2000. In May, at Clark University, 50 people gathered to discuss only walking issues. Later in the year, at the Worcester Holiday Inn, 50 people focused only on bicycling issues. \n\nIn 2005, the conference moved to Boston. The first several years, the conference was held at the Marriott Courtyard on Tremont Street. Interest continued to grow until attendance hit approximately 250 persons and the conference moved to a larger venue at the Back Bay Sheraton. \n\nThe conference continued to grow and in 2013 the conference was held for the first time at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. Transit joined the conference as a featured mode. In 2014, more workshops than ever were offered along with the addition of site visits. Over 650 people attended the event. It continued to bring together transportation leaders and individuals involved in the areas of planning, public health, bike and pedestrian safety, transit, advocacy, elected office, law enforcement and education."},

While the work of educators can be a source of great professional and personal satisfaction, all too often these multiple demands also produce uncertainty, stress, and feelings of being overwhelmed that can lead to personal burnout and organizational challenges.\n\nMindfulness for Educators provides a practical and enjoyable introduction to the many benefits of mindfulness for teachers, administrators, and educational leaders. You will practice a range of engaging and relaxing techniques that can be put to immediate use at work and at home.  Designed for educators across all levels and disciplines, the program helps participants begin to build the inner strengths to incorporate mindfulness into their day-to-day work lives.\n\nProgram Details\nThis three-day workshop offers an introductory exploration of the many ways that mindfulness can help address challenges and reconnect with the joys of being educational professionals. Through a combination of relaxing and playful exercises, interactive discussion, introductory meditation and movement practices, and small group conversation, you will identify ways to respond to stress more constructively, better balance your inner needs with your outer responsibilities, and develop practical strategies to engage life, work, and the challenges of being educators in a more balanced, fulfilling, effective, and sustainable ways.\n\nOur two guest faculty will share their experiences working in schools and in diverse community settings. The Holistic Life Foundation (HLF), is a Baltimore-based non-profit organization with a mission to nurture the wellness of children and adults in underserved communities and empower individuals and organizations through yoga, mindfulness, and self-care practices.

A 2016 report by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that 46 percent of teachers feel high daily stress. And in a recent Teaching Tolerance survey of 10,000 educators, 9 in 10 of them reported that since the election, there has been a negative affect on student mood and behavior and that anxiety, harassment, fights and insults in schools have increase dramatically.  \n\nHowever, new cognitive, social and biological sciences may hold the answers to reducing stress, anxiety and behavior problems to students and teachers.

We share our experiences. \n \nWith lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.\n \nOur communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can\u2019t experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.\n \nAt the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. \n \nWe come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism\u2014about white supremacy\u2014affirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. \n \nWe know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. \n \nWe celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn\u2019t want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations\u2014our art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.\n \nCome home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities\u2014to build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don\u2019t all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  \n \nWe hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom."},
