Data Wise provides the tools and protocols to enable you and your colleagues to engage in an effective collaborative process around data.\n\nThe Data Wise Improvement Process provides a clear, carefully tested blueprint that teachers, school leaders, and system-level leaders can use to examine a wide range of data and catalyze conversations that drive instructional improvement. The Data Wise Leadership Institute prepares teams to plan a thoughtful launch of this inquiry process in their own settings.\n\nProgram Details\nIn response to high demand, we are now offering a January version of the Data Wise Leadership Institute that provides a more intimate experience on Harvard\u2019s campus. During this intensive week, your school or system-level team will interact face-to-face with the Data Wise teaching team, peers from diverse settings, and Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) students who are committed to learning how to lead collaborative inquiry. The January institute covers the same topics as the June program but allows more independent team time for collaboration and provides access to a shared teaching fellow.\n\nWe strongly recommend that teams also enroll in the Data Wise in Action Program, where you will receive four months of continued support from a dedicated Data Wise coach as you implement the inquiry process in your own school or system. Teams applying for both programs will be given preference during the admissions process and participants in the leadership institute receive a discount for the Data Wise In Action Program in the same calendar year.\n\nObjectives\nExplore how the Data Wise Improvement Process brings coherence to the core work of schools\nCultivate the habits of mind that improve team effectiveness and foster a supportive culture of improvement\nPractice using a series of inquiry protocols that you can bring back to your faculty\nCreate a plan for integrating the Data Wise Improvement Process into your daily work\n"},

The programming is geared towards heads of school and their leadership teams, and attendees leave feeling energized and with tools and information to strengthen their schools. \n\nLeadership, both in concept and in practice, is a journey rather than a destination. Join us at the 2018 NAIS Annual Conference this March 7 \u2013 9, in Atlanta to explore the possibilities of your own leadership journey, whether you lead as a head of school, teacher, trustee, or in multiple roles. Along with other aspects of a changing world and education landscape, the independent school community is faced with shifting mindsets about who leads and how we lead. When NAIS was founded over 50 years ago, the concept of leadership looked remarkedly different than it does today. While many of the building blocks of effective and inspiring leadership remain the same, we now know there are countless styles, personalities, and skills that can help us be authentic, engaged, and innovative leaders whether in the classroom, a board meeting, or as a head of school.\n \nWho is leading our schools is just as important as how they are doing it. Women and people of color remain underrepresented in many top leadership roles in our schools, Millennials are challenging preconceived notions of success, and retirement is in reach for many heads of school. As we prepare ourselves and our students for the future, we must examine who is preparing and refining their leadership skills and what pathways they are taking along the way."},

The Data Wise Leadership Institute prepares teams to plan a thoughtful launch of this inquiry process in their own settings.\n\nProgram Details\nDuring this intensive week on Harvard\u2019s campus your school or system-level team will work with a dedicated facilitator and peers from diverse settings who are similarly committed to learning how to lead collaborative inquiry. The intensive course will get your team energized as you learn the Data Wise process and work on developing three essential habits: shared commitment to action, intentional collaboration, and a relentless focus on evidence.Note: The June institute addresses the same objectives as the January program but includes additional faculty presentations and in-class time for teams to meet with a dedicated coach for discussion.\n\nWe strongly recommend that teams also enroll in the Data Wise in Action Program, where you will receive four months of continued support from a dedicated Data Wise coach as you implement the inquiry process in your own school or system. Teams applying for both programs will be given preference during the admissions process and participants in the leadership institute receive a discount for the Data Wise In Action Program in the same calendar year.\n\nObjectives\nExplore how the Data Wise Improvement Process brings coherence to the core work of schools\nCultivate the habits of mind that improve team effectiveness and foster a supportive culture of improvement\nPractice using a series of inquiry protocols that you can bring back to your faculty\nCreate a plan for integrating the Data Wise Improvement Process into your daily work"},

We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.\n \nOur communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can\u2019t experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.\n \nAt the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. \n \nWe come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism\u2014about white supremacy\u2014affirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. \n \nWe know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. \n \nWe celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn\u2019t want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations\u2014our art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.\n \nCome home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities\u2014to build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don\u2019t all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  \n \nWe hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom."},
