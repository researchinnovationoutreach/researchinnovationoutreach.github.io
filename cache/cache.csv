Writer as Reader,"Literature, Humanities",The Bard College Institute for Writing & Thinking ,"Friday, September 28, 2018",,"Annandale-on-Hudson, NY","Among the key criteria for English/Language Arts is a focus on the close reading of texts‚Äîpreparing students to read more carefully, grasp the meaning in more complex texts, and to infer meaning from what they read. IWT‚Äôs ‚ÄúWriter as Reader‚Äù workshops model writing practices that support close reading and Common Core standards in all subjects, and invite secondary and college teachers to consider ‚Äúwriting to read‚Äù as a central classroom practice, one that shows rather than tells students how writing clarifies meaning in literary, historical, and nonfiction texts. These techniques are the starting point for each workshop.

IWT workshops also invite readers to find their own ways into a text. Working with diverse writing-to-read strategies, workshop participants discover what they bring to the text, what is noticeable in the text and what is inferred, and what questions the text poses.
 
This year we will include sessions on novels, poetry, nonfiction, historical documents, STEM texts, and other media. As educators have come to expect, these workshops focus on putting texts into conversations with other texts, with historical events, and digital media.  The ‚ÄúWriter as Reader‚Äù workshops also model writing and reading activities that can focus class discussion, help students engage with difficult material, and emphasize the social character of all learning.",http://writingandthinking.org/programs/september/,,

Learning Environments for Tomorrow: Next Practices for Educators and Architects,Pedagogy,Harvard Graduate School of Education,"Tuesday, October 2, 2018","Thursday, October 4, 2018","Cambridge, MA","Collaborate with architects and educators from around the world to apply principles of effective pedagogy and design to physical learning environment projects.

Overview
Physical spaces have an enormous impact on learners‚Äô experiences. Building layouts can create opportunities for new relationships among students, staff, and the community. Furniture arrangements in classrooms and hallways can foster planned collaboration and spontaneous informal learning among students. Day-lighting, learning commons, and natural materials can create a sense of place and connection.

Whether we‚Äôre engaged in small-scale classroom remodeling or large-scale school planning, effective designs are based on clear sense of learners‚Äô needs and educational goals. How can we understand the needs of the learners and the community for whom we are designing? What are the educational goals that should inform effective designs? And how can we plan and prototype solutions so they can evolve as needs and goals change over time?

Participants learn from educational and design leaders about emerging trends shaping today and tomorrow‚Äôs educational environments such as ubiquitous technologies, personalized learning, sustainable construction, and collaboration. Working in team-based design studios, participants apply the program content by engaging in a design process that spans five areas: the needs of people, design principles, program goals, plans, and prototypes. The program offers content and a process that participants can apply and bring back to their settings.  

Program Details
In this three-day collaborative program, you and your team will explore themes that inform 21st-century school design, such as collaboration, technology, engagement, and sustainability. You will take part in interactive plenary sessions given by leaders in the field of education and architecture, topic-specific workshops led by innovative practitioners and thinkers, guided site visits to provocative learning environments in the Boston-area, and a ‚Äúdesign studio,‚Äù facilitated by experts in collaborative design processes. 

Each component is crafted to create opportunities for your team to consider the needs and values of your learners, the forward-looking educational goals for your community, and the qualities of the spaces that can support such needs and goals. Participants will have the opportunity to focus on a specific school design project they are currently involved in, or to work more abstractly within their design teams. Design studios will offer daily opportunities to get feedback on your plans and future prototyping can support the educational experiences for your community.

Teaching Students to Ask Their Own Questions: Best Practices in the Question Formulation Technique,Pedagogy,Harvard Graduate School of Education,"Monday, October 15, 2018","Sunday, November 4, 2018",Online,"Students who learn to ask their own questions become more curious, take ownership of their learning, and demonstrate greater comprehension of challenging content. The ability to ask one‚Äôs own questions is, indeed, one of the most important lifelong learning skills a student can acquire in the course of their education and, yet, it is rarely deliberately taught to all students. 

Overview
Introduced by former Dean James Ryan, Teaching Students to Ask Their Own Questions will be led by staff of the Right Question Institute (RQI), including Dan Rothstein and Luz Santana, RQI co-directors and co-authors of Make Just One Change: Teach Students to Ask Their Own Questions, which has quickly become a classic pedagogical text for strengthening inquiry in all classrooms, from kindergarten through higher education. The workshop will offer a differentiated active learning experience in the Question Formulation Technique (QFT), a simple yet robust method for teaching students to ask better questions that was developed by Rothstein and Santana through years of trial and error and practice-based research.

Program Details
The publication of Make Just One Change was a catalyst for hundreds of thousands of educators around the world to adopt the QFT and generate new knowledge about how to use it for different purposes. The experience and knowledge of educators in a remarkably wide range of classrooms inform the content and structure of this workshop on ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù in using the QFT. The workshop offers a very special opportunity for all educators, those new to the QFT and those already experienced in using it, to learn more about innovative ways to teach the skill of question formulation by applying the QFT for different teaching and learning goals in all kinds of classrooms.

The workshop will provide an in-depth exploration of key components for successful application of the QFT, including:

What is the core structure and flow of the QFT?
Why does the structure work across all classrooms and for all students?
What are best practices in adapting the QFT for your teaching and learning goals?
How does the facilitation of the QFT change some traditional expectations of teacher and student roles in learning?
What are ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù in design and facilitation of your use of the QFT?
The workshop will deploy a variety of teaching and learning methods to engage participants in individual as well as collaborative problem-solving, reflection, and engagement with QFT tools and resources. Instructional videos, readings, and online discussions will complement peer-to-peer learning with educators across diverse learning environments.

The online workshop will require a total of 10-12 hours of work. Participants will receive a certificate indicating completion of 10 clock hours of instruction.

Objectives
Understand how and why the skill of question-asking is critical to student achievement and agency in and out of the classroom
Learn the art and science behind the Question Formulation Technique (QFT)
Study and discuss examples of how the QFT is being used to promote increased student engagement and deeper learning among all students

Improving Math Instruction Through Feedback is an online professional development program for K-12 educators looking to improve instructional coaching for math teachers. Based upon the research of HGSE Professor Heather Hill, the workshop provides strategies for promoting high-quality math instruction and explores the role of school leaders, instructional coaches, and peer teachers in that process. The workshop begins with an introduction to Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI), an observation instrument and set of protocols that support teachers, coaches, and principals in analyzing instruction and planning for improvement. You will then practice observing classrooms and engaging in coaching conversations using MQI and other protocols.  In the final portion of the workshop, you will explore strategies for using rubric-based coaching with instructional video capture in your own setting.

Admissions and enrollment management are inherently deeply human processes.  While managing data - applicant and yield numbers, test scores, and demographic statistics - is part of the job, the real work is about human connection.  As we seek to build relationships with prospective and current families and students, especially new generations of millennials and Gen Z, developing a deep understanding of their world views and evolving needs will ensure our admissions processes resonate with mission aligned audiences.
Human Centered Design (also known as Design Thinking) is a set of habits, mindsets and skill sets that you can learn and practice that will allow you and your team to be better listeners, experience designers, empathetic problem solvers, and leaders. Over the course of two-days we will learn and practice design elements.  As schools seek greater diversity, equity and inclusion, design thinking can expand the ways we connect with a broader constituency.",http://www.leadershipanddesign.org/design-studio-designing-for-admissions-and-enrollment-management.html,,

The theme for the 2018 VAIS Leading Learning Conference (LLC) is Better Together. In an age of lightning fast social media, file-sharing, email, and texts, we have innumerable opportunities to connect every day, and yet, in education, we sometimes feel isolated in our classrooms and offices, and in our schools. Instead of isolation, we wish for connection, cohesion and community, because we know that we are better together than we are apart. Community is essential to education--we learn from one other, we cheer each other on toward success, and we thrive by including others.  This year the VAIS Professional Development Advisory Commission (PDAC) sought proposals that inspire students, teachers, administrators, and schools to connect anew. Sessions should challenge PK-12 teachers and academic administrators to share a variety of models and strategies, skills, resources and tools, opportunities, and ideas that support connectivity and community at all levels. Some potential themes for presentations include, but are not limited to:
Inclusion, in the classroom, school or curricula;
Innovative technologies connecting students locally and internationally;
Community-building in the classroom, the school and beyond;
Mentoring programs for new teachers and/or younger students;
Idea-sharing among educators and administrators;
Leveraging community resources, tangible and intangible
Join us and be a part of this amazingly energizing day!  Immerse yourself in learning something new, network with your colleagues, make some new friends, challenge yourself, and have FUN!  Because, it is far better to be together in learning.

IWT‚Äôs ‚ÄúWriter as Reader‚Äù workshops model writing practices that support close reading and Common Core standards in all subjects, and invite secondary and college teachers to consider ‚Äúwriting to read‚Äù as a central classroom practice, one that shows rather than tells students how writing clarifies meaning in literary, historical, and nonfiction texts. These techniques are the starting point for each workshop.

IWT workshops also invite readers to find their own ways into a text. Working with diverse writing-to-read strategies, workshop participants discover what they bring to the text, what is noticeable in the text and what is inferred, and what questions the text poses.
 
This year we will include sessions on novels, poetry, nonfiction, historical documents, STEM texts, and other media. As educators have come to expect, these workshops focus on putting texts into conversations with other texts, with historical events, and digital media.

Some of the most significant innovations in education over the past 20 years have come from visionary entrepreneurs, but while the field is dotted with small successes, there are few examples of long-standing, widespread implementation. Too often, promising products and services never become available at scale.

Scaling For Impact is designed for nonprofit education organizations that are ready to expand and extend their impact. Participants will explore barriers to growth, including increased demands on leadership teams, difficulties in accessing funds, and threats to quality and sustainability. They will look at the pros and cons of different paths to scale, such as brick-and-mortar versus online options, replication versus adaptation, collective impact models, and more. The program provides a rare opportunity for education entrepreneurs to connect with each other as they share successes and challenges and build a network for ongoing support.

Program Details
This three-day program is designed for education entrepreneurs with a proven program, product, or service. Harvard faculty will introduce different approaches to achieving impact at scale, drawing on case studies and experts from the field to illustrate successful scaling strategies. You will explore opportunities for assessing impact, organizing to execute, and sustaining a culture of success.

Teams selected to participate will be expected to identify a problem of practice that they intend to work on during the program. Your team will have dedicated time to work with an experienced facilitator as you define your theory of social impact and develop an action plan that applies what you have learned to the practical challenges facing your organization.

Objectives

DESIGN STUDIO: Designing for Student Civic Engagement,"Leadership, Innovation, School Design, Humanities, History",Leadership + Design,"Wednesday, March 20, 2019","Thursday, March 21, 2019","Washington, DC","When was the last time you had a chance to put students and their teachers alongside one another as learners, co-designers, and change agents?

We are living through an exciting moment of increased student civic engagement, as groups of youth have begun to raise their voices in service of causes that are important to them.  That engagement takes many forms, ranging from organizing protests to developing local partnerships in order to make change in their communities. Young people are searching for more authentic opportunities to get involved, beyond the obligatory community service hours or service learning programs that many schools require of their students.  As teaching and learning evolves to emphasize real-world, impact-driven projects, schools and colleges are searching for ways to engage students in the community in authentic and meaningful ways.  While a good deal of recent activity has been student-led, student civic engagement can be particularly powerful when it is guided by a caring and committed adult or sponsor who can serve as a coach. 

We are partnering with Episcopal High School in Washington D.C. to offer Designing for Student Civic Engagement, a two-day workshop for the adult and student leaders (high school or college-aged) who are working to make change in some capacity, and who would like to learn and practice some skills and frameworks to help guide and organize their work, both with each other and in the community.  Meant for teams made up of 1-2 school leaders who work directly with student leaders AND 2-3 of those student leaders with whom they work, Designing for Student Civic Engagement will provide a boost of effectiveness and purpose as we explore the habits, mindsets, and tools of Design Thinking, particularly as they apply to civic engagement and social change.  Participants will practice strategies for conducting empathy-based research, defining the problem they are hoping to solve, and will learn to collaborate to develop creative solutions alongside members of their community. We‚Äôll also dig into the interpersonal side of civic engagement: what do we do when we experience conflict? How can we better work together as a team?  Teams will return to their school with a new set of tools they can immediately apply in their civic engagement work.

Using Busboys and Poets as inspirational space and our home base, teams will take a deep dive into a real-world design challenge posed by a community partner, challenging them to dive into the U Street Corridor neighborhood of D.C.  Our design challenge will give student leaders (and those coaching them) a chance to learn and practice some strategies for making connections in a local community, uncovering real human needs, and learning to design solutions with rather than for others.  During our time together, we'll also include opportunities for student and adult/sponsor participants to reflect and discuss the work separately from one another, as students learn to take leadership and sponsors learn to serve as a guide on the side.

Overview
Technology and new learning modalities are fundamentally redefining how individuals access information and, thus, the role of the library. Library leaders must stay a step ahead of this change, asking: What will learning look like in the next decade? What support will community members need to access quality information, and what role can libraries play as digital media take on a larger role in society?

Library Leadership in a Digital Age offers library leaders a chance to reimagine their work in the context of a changing information landscape. Participants will gather with policymakers and experts to examine how new technologies are redefining learning and to develop practical strategies for leading libraries during this uncertain and dynamic time.

Program Details
During this three-day program, you will explore the changes occurring in the field of knowledge management and consider the implications for libraries and library leadership. In interactive presentations, panel question-and-answer sessions, and small group discussions, you will dive into big questions, such as: Is tomorrow‚Äôs library a physical place, a set of information services, or something else? How can libraries become the architects and shepherds of intellectual communities? You will also have opportunities to share insights and practical ideas with your peers and time to set goals for how you will adapt to and embrace the opportunities ahead.

Objectives
Understand the role of libraries in the digital age
Become a more effective library leader in a rapidly changing institutional context
Consider the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and limitations, and promises and pitfalls of new digital media, resources, and opportunities
Examine new design and delivery options for library resources and services",https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ppe/program/library-leadership-digital-age,,

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. 
 
With lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.
 
Our communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can‚Äôt experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.
 
At the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. 
 
We come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism‚Äîabout white supremacy‚Äîaffirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. 
 
We know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. 
 
We celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn‚Äôt want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations‚Äîour art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.
 
Come home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities‚Äîto build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives.

‚ÄúEvery essay ‚Ä¶creates a working ethos of attempting ‚Äì to the utmost ‚Äì the improbable.‚Äù   
Joan Retallack

Essay writing is often a struggle for many students, with the transition from high school to college-level expectations proving to be one of the most academically challenging shifts. Expectations for high school papers ‚Äì whether the five-paragraph ‚Äútheme‚Äù or the three-point AP model ‚Äì do not, typically, meet traditional standards for college writing.  Questions of audience, various styles of argumentation, the uses of evidence ‚Äì and even such basic requirements as a thesis rather than a topic sentence or disciplinary-specific citation-styles ‚Äì can radically diverge from what students have been accustomed to in grades 8-12.  How can high school teachers, who often feel as if they are ‚Äústraddling the line‚Äù between providing the basics of reading comprehension and preparing students for the more complex thinking required by college courses ‚Äì help bridge these gaps? 

This year‚Äôs annual conference provides teachers and professors with an opportunity to reconsider how the modes of writing that students learn in high school can be utilized in college. In Habits of the Creative Mind (2016), Ann Jurecic and Richard E. Miller propose that ‚Äúthe best writing is curiosity driven and is carried forward by creative acts of connective thinking.‚Äù This kind of writing stands in direct contrast to the more typical ‚Äúrecipe-based approach‚Äù that results in formulaic prose. How do we encourage students of all levels to see ‚Äúwriting as an act of thinking‚Äù?

As Paul Connolly, IWT‚Äôs founding director, said in an interview in 1983, ‚Äúmost students seem to be going through the motion of writing. They're not attached to it. Their writing tends to be perfunctory and it tends to be thoughtless."" How do we encourage imaginative thinking and the valuing of the writing process, while also fulfilling the demands of standardized testing and state standards? How might writing-based practices for deepening critical analysis better prepare high school students for college? What classroom practices can address such specific needs as, how do we engage students as readers and writers while asking them to conform to the particular demands of form, style, and content?  

This year‚Äôs conference will address these questions from theoretical and practical standpoints.  Together, we will write to explore how the essay is approached in both high school and college; with particular attention to the ‚Äúhigh school essay‚Äù that is part of the college application process. We will look to IWT‚Äôs signature writing-based teaching practices for new ways to use informal and formal writing to foster community, help students respond productively to intellectual challenges, and smooth the transition from one set of skills to another ‚Äì with a minimum anxiety.

The Life Guard Teacher Fellowships will support the creation or dramatic transformation of curriculum materials, lesson plans, website content, interpretive tools, or other education resources to support a 21st-century classroom‚Äôs needs. The subject of said materials must relate to teaching about George Washington and the founding era. Four to six fellowships will be awarded during the 2017-18 cycle. 

Successful applications will demonstrate knowledge of curriculum connections to George Washington and the founding era; the ability to integrate the material with national and state-based models for student assessment and standards; and will make use of Mount Vernon‚Äôs existing online and onsite expertise and resources. The proposed project should show both creativity and practicality so that it pushes innovation and also can be adopted in a variety of classroom environments.  

Fellowships awarded are for one to three weeks of consecutive or non-consecutive study between June 2017 and August 2018.

Systems thinking stems from the premise that students deepen their thinking and expand their knowledge when they're encouraged to make connections between their learning and the natural and human-made systems around them.

Systems thinking fosters a learning environment where students explore ethical, environmental, and global issues holistically encouraging both increased personal responsibility and social action. It also enlivens and invigorates teachers' planning and practice.
