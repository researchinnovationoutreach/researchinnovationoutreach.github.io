2017 Moving Together Conference,"Science, Sustainability, Humanities, Social Justice, Health",Umass Amherst,"Thu, Sep 28, 2017",,"Boston, MA","The History of the Moving Together Conference
In 1998, both the statewide bicycling action plan and the statewide pedestrian action plan, called for the establishment of an annual statewide conference for educational and networking purposes. The first two of these conferences were held in Worcester, MA in 2000. In May, at Clark University, 50 people gathered to discuss only walking issues. Later in the year, at the Worcester Holiday Inn, 50 people focused only on bicycling issues. 

In 2005, the conference moved to Boston. The first several years, the conference was held at the Marriott Courtyard on Tremont Street. Interest continued to grow until attendance hit approximately 250 persons and the conference moved to a larger venue at the Back Bay Sheraton. 

The conference continued to grow and in 2013 the conference was held for the first time at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. Transit joined the conference as a featured mode. In 2014, more workshops than ever were offered along with the addition of site visits. Over 650 people attended the event. It continued to bring together transportation leaders and individuals involved in the areas of planning, public health, bike and pedestrian safety, transit, advocacy, elected office, law enforcement and education.",http://www.umasstransportationcenter.org/assnfe/ev.asp?ID=2778,,

IWT‚Äôs ‚ÄúWriter as Reader‚Äù workshops model writing practices that support close reading and Common Core standards in all subjects, and invite secondary and college teachers to consider ‚Äúwriting to read‚Äù as a central classroom practice, one that shows rather than tells students how writing clarifies meaning in literary, historical, and nonfiction texts. These techniques are the starting point for each workshop.

IWT workshops also invite readers to find their own ways into a text. Working with diverse writing-to-read strategies, workshop participants discover what they bring to the text, what is noticeable in the text and what is inferred, and what questions the text poses.
 
This year we will include sessions on novels, poetry, nonfiction, historical documents, STEM texts, and other media. As educators have come to expect, these workshops focus on putting texts into conversations with other texts, with historical events, and digital media.

Overview
Today‚Äôs educators face relentless demands‚Äîcalls to do more with less, address conflicting concerns of multiple constituencies, and grapple with constant change. While the work of educators can be a source of great professional and personal satisfaction, all too often these multiple demands also produce uncertainty, stress, and feelings of being overwhelmed that can lead to personal burnout and organizational challenges.

Mindfulness for Educators provides a practical and enjoyable introduction to the many benefits of mindfulness for teachers, administrators, and educational leaders. You will practice a range of engaging and relaxing techniques that can be put to immediate use at work and at home.  Designed for educators across all levels and disciplines, the program helps participants begin to build the inner strengths to incorporate mindfulness into their day-to-day work lives.

Program Details
This three-day workshop offers an introductory exploration of the many ways that mindfulness can help address challenges and reconnect with the joys of being educational professionals. Through a combination of relaxing and playful exercises, interactive discussion, introductory meditation and movement practices, and small group conversation, you will identify ways to respond to stress more constructively, better balance your inner needs with your outer responsibilities, and develop practical strategies to engage life, work, and the challenges of being educators in a more balanced, fulfilling, effective, and sustainable ways.

"Teaching Self-Regulation: Balancing Affect, Behavior, and Cognition for Success","Counseling, Health",Learning & The Brain,"Mon, Dec 4, 2017",,"White Plains, NY","As an educator, you know what you want for your students. You want them to seek out challenges, ask for help, resist distraction, and see mistakes as chances to try again. In other words, you want kids to be self-regulated learners. Self-regulation for learning (SRL) is the ability to effectively balance Affect (how you feel), Behaviors (what you do), and Cognition (how to think) to pursue worthy academic goals. Teaching students to balance these three elements builds motivation, resilience, and college and career readiness. In this interactive session, learn doable, evidence-based practices to help students engage in learning, build confidence, set and manage goals, develop habits of thinking, do effective home study, and reflect on their learning. Hear real stories of students who achieved success through SRL skills. You will be provided a framework for both classroom practice and schoolwide implementation. Discover how schools have used this whole child approach to assisting students in gaining greater social/emotional well-being, developing scholarly behaviors, and acquiring valuable thinking tools to be successful in school and beyond.

Overview
Instructional rounds‚Äîa practice adapted to education from the field of medicine‚Äîoffers a structure for educators to work together to solve common problems and improve their practice. The model has been used in schools and across districts to raise the quality of instruction for all students.

This intensive course is led by the Harvard faculty who created the methodology and authored Instructional Rounds in Education. It includes opportunities to observe real-world classrooms, where participant teams apply protocols, build their observational skills, and consider how to integrate such practices in their own schools and districts. 

Program Details
This five-day program is designed for school and district teams. Recent program updates reflect lessons learned from working with educators in the field.

Prior to arriving in Cambridge, participants should read Instructional Rounds in Education (included in tuition) and prepare responses to study guide questions. You will also need to complete a classroom observation and hold one team meeting when you will craft a group essay and plan for your on-campus work. Detailed instructions for pre-program work will be supplied to all accepted teams. Individuals should expect to spend about 20 hours on pre-program assignments.

During the on-campus program, you will experience rounds simulations and conduct classroom observations at local schools. You will also have dedicated daily time to meet with your team as you define and refine your rounds practice.

After the program, your team will implement the skills and protocols learned in your home setting.

Objectives
Understand the instructional core, the power of focusing attention on learning tasks, and the elements of a school or system that support continuous instructional improvement
Learn to use protocols and a structured process to collaboratively observe classroom instruction, analyze learning tasks, and develop ideas for next steps in an ongoing improvement cycle

Overview
Making sense of data is critical, but so too is the process for ensuring this data impacts teaching and learning. Data Wise provides the tools and protocols to enable you and your colleagues to engage in an effective collaborative process around data.

The Data Wise Improvement Process provides a clear, carefully tested blueprint that teachers, school leaders, and system-level leaders can use to examine a wide range of data and catalyze conversations that drive instructional improvement. The Data Wise Leadership Institute prepares teams to plan a thoughtful launch of this inquiry process in their own settings.

Program Details
In response to high demand, we are now offering a January version of the Data Wise Leadership Institute that provides a more intimate experience on Harvard‚Äôs campus. During this intensive week, your school or system-level team will interact face-to-face with the Data Wise teaching team, peers from diverse settings, and Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) students who are committed to learning how to lead collaborative inquiry. The January institute covers the same topics as the June program but allows more independent team time for collaboration and provides access to a shared teaching fellow.

We strongly recommend that teams also enroll in the Data Wise in Action Program, where you will receive four months of continued support from a dedicated Data Wise coach as you implement the inquiry process in your own school or system. Teams applying for both programs will be given preference during the admissions process and participants in the leadership institute receive a discount for the Data Wise In Action Program in the same calendar year.

The programming is geared towards heads of school and their leadership teams, and attendees leave feeling energized and with tools and information to strengthen their schools. 

Leadership, both in concept and in practice, is a journey rather than a destination. Join us at the 2018 NAIS Annual Conference this March 7 ‚Äì 9, in Atlanta to explore the possibilities of your own leadership journey, whether you lead as a head of school, teacher, trustee, or in multiple roles. Along with other aspects of a changing world and education landscape, the independent school community is faced with shifting mindsets about who leads and how we lead. When NAIS was founded over 50 years ago, the concept of leadership looked remarkedly different than it does today. While many of the building blocks of effective and inspiring leadership remain the same, we now know there are countless styles, personalities, and skills that can help us be authentic, engaged, and innovative leaders whether in the classroom, a board meeting, or as a head of school.
 
Who is leading our schools is just as important as how they are doing it. Women and people of color remain underrepresented in many top leadership roles in our schools, Millennials are challenging preconceived notions of success, and retirement is in reach for many heads of school. As we prepare ourselves and our students for the future, we must examine who is preparing and refining their leadership skills and what pathways they are taking along the way.",http://annualconference.nais.org/Pages/default.aspx,,
Scaling For Impact: Strategies to Enhance and Expand What Works in Education,"Leadership, School Design","Harvard University: Graduate School of Education, PreK-12 Professional Education Programs","Wed, Mar 7, 2018","Fri, Mar 9, 2018","Cambridge, MA","Discover strategies for expanding, adapting, and sustaining a successful venture to achieve greater impact.

Overview
Some of the most significant innovations in education over the past 20 years have come from visionary entrepreneurs, but while the field is dotted with small successes, there are few examples of long-standing, widespread implementation. Too often, promising products and services never become available at scale.

Scaling For Impact is designed for nonprofit education organizations that are ready to expand and extend their impact. Participants will explore barriers to growth, including increased demands on leadership teams, difficulties in accessing funds, and threats to quality and sustainability. They will look at the pros and cons of different paths to scale, such as brick-and-mortar versus online options, replication versus adaptation, collective impact models, and more. The program provides a rare opportunity for education entrepreneurs to connect with each other as they share successes and challenges and build a network for ongoing support.

Program Details
This three-day program is designed for education entrepreneurs with a proven program, product, or service. Harvard faculty will introduce different approaches to achieving impact at scale, drawing on case studies and experts from the field to illustrate successful scaling strategies. You will explore opportunities for assessing impact, organizing to execute, and sustaining a culture of success.

Teams selected to participate will be expected to identify a problem of practice that they intend to work on during the program. Your team will have dedicated time to work with an experienced facilitator as you define your theory of social impact and develop an action plan that applies what you have learned to the practical challenges facing your organization.

Objectives
Explore effective strategies and leadership skills for scaling for impact and acquire tools and frameworks to help you determine if and how you will scale
Understand the tensions and trade-offs associated with various scaling decisions
Learn lessons from the field, including tripwires to avoid and opportunities to seize
Refine your own theory of social impact and apply research and best practices to diagnose your scaling challenges
Develop specific next steps and clarify respective roles in this work
Build useful professional connections

Overview
Technology and new learning modalities are fundamentally redefining how individuals access information and, thus, the role of the library. Library leaders must stay a step ahead of this change, asking: What will learning look like in the next decade? What support will community members need to access quality information, and what role can libraries play as digital media take on a larger role in society?

Library Leadership in a Digital Age offers library leaders a chance to reimagine their work in the context of a changing information landscape. Participants will gather with policymakers and experts to examine how new technologies are redefining learning and to develop practical strategies for leading libraries during this uncertain and dynamic time.

Program Details
During this three-day program, you will explore the changes occurring in the field of knowledge management and consider the implications for libraries and library leadership. In interactive presentations, panel question-and-answer sessions, and small group discussions, you will dive into big questions, such as: Is tomorrow‚Äôs library a physical place, a set of information services, or something else? How can libraries become the architects and shepherds of intellectual communities? You will also have opportunities to share insights and practical ideas with your peers and time to set goals for how you will adapt to and embrace the opportunities ahead.

Objectives
Understand the role of libraries in the digital age
Become a more effective library leader in a rapidly changing institutional context
Consider the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and limitations, and promises and pitfalls of new digital media, resources, and opportunities
Examine new design and delivery options for library resources and services",https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ppe/program/library-leadership-digital-age,,

Scientific research has found that stress, anxiety and behavior problems in children can affect the structure of the brain and reduce learning and motivation. Yet stress and behavior problems are on the rise in schools. An APA ""Stress in America"" Study found that overall stress levels in adults in 2017 has increased for the first time in 10 years, with more than two-thirds being stressed, and millennials with higher stress levels than any other group; and the APA's 2014 report found that 27 percent of teens experience ""extreme stress"" during school. A 2016 report by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that 46 percent of teachers feel high daily stress. And in a recent Teaching Tolerance survey of 10,000 educators, 9 in 10 of them reported that since the election, there has been a negative affect on student mood and behavior and that anxiety, harassment, fights and insults in schools have increase dramatically.  

However, new cognitive, social and biological sciences may hold the answers to reducing stress, anxiety and behavior problems to students and teachers. Research has found that both negative and positive emotions, mindfulness meditation, promoting emotional agility, personality traits, and classroom management all affect the brain and mood and can all be used to significantly reduce stress and increase academic achievement.  Learn about the ""Science of Stress, Emotions, and Behavior""; the impact of anxiety, emotions, and behavior on the brain and achievement; how to manage behavior problems in students; strategies to reduce social, test and performance anxiety; how teachers can do more with less time and overcome burnout and the feeling of being overwhelmed, and the benefits of mindfulness for students, teachers and administrators.

Unsurprisingly, there has also been an increase in articles with headlines like ‚Äú4 Tips to Teach Kindness,‚Äù ‚ÄúCreating Equitable and Just Classrooms‚Äù and ‚ÄúTalking About Tolerance.‚Äù 

By definition, a classroom is a space where ‚Äústudents gather collectively‚Äù‚Äîa place where many different individuals come together to form a learning community.

This year‚Äôs annual conference provides an opportunity for us to think and write together to investigate and grapple with issues around difference and equity in the classroom.

Overview
Making sense of data is critical, but so too is the process for ensuring this data impacts teaching and learning. Data Wise provides the tools and protocols to enable you and your colleagues to engage in an effective collaborative process around data.

The Data Wise Improvement Process provides a clear, carefully tested blueprint that teachers, school leaders, and system-level leaders can use to examine a wide range of data and catalyze conversations that drive instructional improvement. The Data Wise Leadership Institute prepares teams to plan a thoughtful launch of this inquiry process in their own settings.

Program Details
During this intensive week on Harvard‚Äôs campus your school or system-level team will work with a dedicated facilitator and peers from diverse settings who are similarly committed to learning how to lead collaborative inquiry. The intensive course will get your team energized as you learn the Data Wise process and work on developing three essential habits: shared commitment to action, intentional collaboration, and a relentless focus on evidence.Note: The June institute addresses the same objectives as the January program but includes additional faculty presentations and in-class time for teams to meet with a dedicated coach for discussion.

We strongly recommend that teams also enroll in the Data Wise in Action Program, where you will receive four months of continued support from a dedicated Data Wise coach as you implement the inquiry process in your own school or system. Teams applying for both programs will be given preference during the admissions process and participants in the leadership institute receive a discount for the Data Wise In Action Program in the same calendar year.

Objectives
Explore how the Data Wise Improvement Process brings coherence to the core work of schools
Cultivate the habits of mind that improve team effectiveness and foster a supportive culture of improvement
Practice using a series of inquiry protocols that you can bring back to your faculty
Create a plan for integrating the Data Wise Improvement Process into your daily work",https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ppe/program/data-wise-leadership-institute-campus,,

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. 
 
With lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.
 
Our communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can‚Äôt experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.
 
At the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. 
 
We come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism‚Äîabout white supremacy‚Äîaffirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. 
 
We know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. 
 
We celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn‚Äôt want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations‚Äîour art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.
 
Come home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities‚Äîto build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don‚Äôt all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  
 
We hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017.

The work of educators and school leaders is filled with ambiguous challenges.  As teaching and learning continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of students, Design Thinking - using the habits, practices and mindsets of designers to create innovative solutions - is one more tool and framework that educators can use to meet those challenges.  

In March 2017, Leadership+Design teamed up with Steelcase designers in Philadelphia and Los Angeles to help participants explore, develop, and practice those skills and mindsets.  These two-day bootcamp experiences provided participants with the opportunity to experience a real-world design challenge and to practice Design Thinking in the context of school.

Participants had the opportunity to:
 Learn the language, process, and mindsets of Design Thinking;
Work in a team to deepen their understanding and practice the habits of collaborative work;
Produce a tangible prototype of a redesigned solution to an educational challenge;
 Meet and connect with other like-minded educators interested in creative and innovative approaches to education;
 Play and have fun.

The bootcamp experience happened simultaneously in versatile and inspiring Steelcase-designed spaces in LA and Philly, allowing the two groups to check in with one another virtually to offer mutual support, insights and encouragement.

As participants, teachers engage in their own writing in order to explore ways to use writing more meaningfully in their classrooms. They participate in a collaborative inquiry community: reading current theory and research, engaging in classroom-based action research, and presenting a professional workshop. Inquiry focuses on the following themes:

CLASSROOM INQUIRY: How can reflecting on my teaching help me ask meaningful questions to improve my practice?

REFLECTION AND IMPLEMENTATION: How do I incorporate change into my practice? How can attention to difference in my classroom inform my pedagogy and/or curriculum?

LANGUAGE AND POWER: How can language be used in a classroom to empower or disempower students? How can a student's native language be valued in my classroom?

LITERACY AND LEARNING: How can I help students become more confident and effective writers and readers? What writing-to-learn and critical reading strategies can I use to help students develop content knowledge and understanding?",https://www.umass.edu/wmwp/wmwp-summer-leadership-institute,,

The 2017 workshop has not yet been announced.

The 2016 Workshop was ""The Rise of Populist Movements Across Europe and Russia."" 

The last few years have witnessed the rise of populist movements both within the United States and abroad. In the US we have seen a movement away from establishment candidates with the rise of Donald Trump and the success of Bernie Sanders. In Europe, the populist parties, France‚Äôs National Front, Britain‚Äôs UKIP, Poland‚Äôs Law and Justice party, Jobbik in Hungary, Austria‚Äôs Freedom Party, and Greece‚Äôs SYRIZA (to name a few) have gained in vote share. In Russia, there are various radical right organizations and parties ranging from the Night Wolves nationalist biker gang to Vladimir Zhirinovsky‚Äôs LDPR.

Voters have come to rally around the idea of ousting establishment candidates and finding those who appeal to the ‚Äúeveryday person,‚Äù the person who is not afraid to stand-up and voice their opinion.

What has led to the success of such parties and candidates in recent years? Is it the economy that has pushed voters more to the extreme sides of the ideological spectrum? Is it a fear of the ‚Äúother‚Äù that is driving the movement? Is this just an aberration that will resolve itself in a few years‚Äô time or is it the new normal?

The one-day event is designed to consider current electoral trends in Europe and Russia.Teachers will discuss and debate current electoral, economic, and multicultural issues facing Europe and Russia to equip themselves with the tools necessary to teach complicated and controversial subjects in schools and community college settings. Participants will consider how changing demographics affect both national and common European senses of identity and the effects of the economy on electoral outcomes.
