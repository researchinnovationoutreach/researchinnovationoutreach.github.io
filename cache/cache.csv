Teaching American History: Online Webinars - Moments of Crisis: Bloody Sunday in Selma,"History, Humanities",Ashbrook Center at Ashland University,"Saturday, March 3, 2018",,Online,"Some 600 peaceful Civil Rights demonstrators sought to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge on 7 March 1965, and were met with police dogs, clubs, and firehoses. The brutal attack by local law enforcement made national headlines and helped to show, in clear terms, the reality of racial segregation throughout much of the South. This event encouraged various civil rights groups to set aside their differences and pledge to work more closely with one another, and drew a quick, sharp response from President Johnson, perhaps spurring him to push harder for even more civil rights legislation.",http://teachingamericanhistory.org/event/moments-of-crisis-bloody-sunday-in-selma/,,

Improving Math Instruction Through Feedback,"Math, STEM, Pedagogy",Harvard Graduate School of Education,"Monday, March 5, 2018","Sunday, March 18, 2018",Online,"Learn practical approaches to improving math instruction using the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) coaching protocols.

Overview
How can the teacher observation process have a greater impact on the day-to-day instruction of math teachers? How can coaching be more specific, effective, and practical in the math classroom?

Improving Math Instruction Through Feedback is an online professional development program for K-12 educators looking to improve instructional coaching for math teachers. Based upon the research of HGSE Professor Heather Hill, the workshop provides strategies for promoting high-quality math instruction and explores the role of school leaders, instructional coaches, and peer teachers in that process. The workshop begins with an introduction to Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI), an observation instrument and set of protocols that support teachers, coaches, and principals in analyzing instruction and planning for improvement. You will then practice observing classrooms and engaging in coaching conversations using MQI and other protocols.  In the final portion of the workshop, you will explore strategies for using rubric-based coaching with instructional video capture in your own setting.

The programming is geared towards heads of school and their leadership teams, and attendees leave feeling energized and with tools and information to strengthen their schools. 

Leadership, both in concept and in practice, is a journey rather than a destination. Join us at the 2018 NAIS Annual Conference this March 7 ‚Äì 9, in Atlanta to explore the possibilities of your own leadership journey, whether you lead as a head of school, teacher, trustee, or in multiple roles. Along with other aspects of a changing world and education landscape, the independent school community is faced with shifting mindsets about who leads and how we lead. When NAIS was founded over 50 years ago, the concept of leadership looked remarkedly different than it does today. While many of the building blocks of effective and inspiring leadership remain the same, we now know there are countless styles, personalities, and skills that can help us be authentic, engaged, and innovative leaders whether in the classroom, a board meeting, or as a head of school.
 
Who is leading our schools is just as important as how they are doing it. Women and people of color remain underrepresented in many top leadership roles in our schools, Millennials are challenging preconceived notions of success, and retirement is in reach for many heads of school. As we prepare ourselves and our students for the future, we must examine who is preparing and refining their leadership skills and what pathways they are taking along the way.",http://annualconference.nais.org/Pages/default.aspx,,
Scaling For Impact: Strategies to Enhance and Expand What Works in Education,"Leadership, School Design","Harvard University: Graduate School of Education, PreK-12 Professional Education Programs","Wednesday, March 7, 2018","Friday, March 9, 2018","Cambridge, MA","Discover strategies for expanding, adapting, and sustaining a successful venture to achieve greater impact.

Overview
Some of the most significant innovations in education over the past 20 years have come from visionary entrepreneurs, but while the field is dotted with small successes, there are few examples of long-standing, widespread implementation. Too often, promising products and services never become available at scale.

Scaling For Impact is designed for nonprofit education organizations that are ready to expand and extend their impact. Participants will explore barriers to growth, including increased demands on leadership teams, difficulties in accessing funds, and threats to quality and sustainability. They will look at the pros and cons of different paths to scale, such as brick-and-mortar versus online options, replication versus adaptation, collective impact models, and more. The program provides a rare opportunity for education entrepreneurs to connect with each other as they share successes and challenges and build a network for ongoing support.

Program Details
This three-day program is designed for education entrepreneurs with a proven program, product, or service. Harvard faculty will introduce different approaches to achieving impact at scale, drawing on case studies and experts from the field to illustrate successful scaling strategies. You will explore opportunities for assessing impact, organizing to execute, and sustaining a culture of success.

Teams selected to participate will be expected to identify a problem of practice that they intend to work on during the program. Your team will have dedicated time to work with an experienced facilitator as you define your theory of social impact and develop an action plan that applies what you have learned to the practical challenges facing your organization.

Objectives
Explore effective strategies and leadership skills for scaling for impact and acquire tools and frameworks to help you determine if and how you will scale
Understand the tensions and trade-offs associated with various scaling decisions
Learn lessons from the field, including tripwires to avoid and opportunities to seize
Refine your own theory of social impact and apply research and best practices to diagnose your scaling challenges
Develop specific next steps and clarify respective roles in this work

The work of educators and school leaders is filled with ambiguous challenges.  As teaching and learning continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of students, school leadership teams likewise need to transform their approach to making change in their schools and their communities.  We need to become more nimble, more comfortable with ambiguity, and more deeply collaborative in our work.

Design Thinking - using the habits, practices and mindsets of designers to create innovative solutions - is one more tool and framework that educators can use to meet those challenges.   The two-day Leadership+Design Bootcamp provides participants with the opportunity to refine and work their problem-solving muscles. They'll experience a real-world design challenge and learn to practice human-centered design strategies to innovate in their schools and beyond.  In particular, we'll explore how design thinking can shape the way we lead and transform our institutions, and local communities, at all levels.  

Participants will have the opportunity to:
 Deepen their understanding of the language, process, and mindsets of Design Thinking, particularly as they apply to educational leadership;
Work in a team to deepen their understanding of and practice the habits of collaborative work and design-inspired leadership;
Explore direct applications of design thinking problem-solving approaches to real-world, community problems through partnership with a local city organization;
Learn some additional ""advanced"" level design thinking tools that can help inform their leadership;
 Meet and connect with other like-minded educators interested in creative and innovative approaches to education;

Discover how becoming a more empathetic leader builds strong teams and relationships in the workplace and at home. Empathy helps create connections across dividing lines. It also increases our ability to relate to our colleagues and family in real and meaningful ways, creating a deeper sense of satisfaction in all areas of our lives.

The business of people is empowered by empathy.

At our 22nd annual Women's Leadership Conference we will explore empathy and its use in our daily lives, how it empowers us individually and as a team, and how it can help each of us to become better, stronger, and more compassionate leaders.

Astonishing in its brazenness, the work of the Plumbers and involvement of the White House dramatically changed how Americans viewed presidential character and the relationship between the press and politicians, ushering in an era of increased partisanship and distrust.

Teaching Students to Ask Their Own Questions: Best Practices in the Question Formulation Technique,Pedagogy,Harvard Graduate School of Education,"Monday, April 9, 2018","Sunday, April 29, 2018",Online,"Students who learn to ask their own questions become more curious, take ownership of their learning, and demonstrate greater comprehension of challenging content. The ability to ask one‚Äôs own questions is, indeed, one of the most important lifelong learning skills a student can acquire in the course of their education and, yet, it is rarely deliberately taught to all students. 

Overview
Introduced by Dean James Ryan, Teaching Students to Ask Their Own Questions will be led by staff of the Right Question Institute (RQI), including Dan Rothstein and Luz Santana, RQI co-directors and co-authors of Make Just One Change: Teach Students to Ask Their Own Questions, which has quickly become a classic pedagogical text for strengthening inquiry in all classrooms, from kindergarten through higher education. The workshop will offer a differentiated active learning experience in the Question Formulation Technique (QFT), a simple yet robust method for teaching students to ask better questions that was developed by Rothstein and Santana through years of trial and error and practice-based research.

Program Details
The publication of Make Just One Change was a catalyst for hundreds of thousands of educators around the world to adopt the QFT and generate new knowledge about how to use it for different purposes. The experience and knowledge of educators in a remarkably wide range of classrooms inform the content and structure of this workshop on ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù in using the QFT. The workshop offers a very special opportunity for all educators, those new to the QFT and those already experienced in using it, to learn more about innovative ways to teach the skill of question formulation by applying the QFT for different teaching and learning goals in all kinds of classrooms.

The workshop will provide an in-depth exploration of key components for successful application of the QFT, including:

What is the core structure and flow of the QFT?
Why does the structure work across all classrooms and for all students?
What are best practices in adapting the QFT for your teaching and learning goals?
How does the facilitation of the QFT change some traditional expectations of teacher and student roles in learning?
What are ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù in design and facilitation of your use of the QFT?
The workshop will deploy a variety of teaching and learning methods to engage participants in individual as well as collaborative problem-solving, reflection, and engagement with QFT tools and resources. Instructional videos, readings, and online discussions will complement peer-to-peer learning with educators across diverse learning environments.

The online workshop will require a total of 10-12 hours of work. Participants will receive a certificate indicating completion of 10 clock hours of instruction.

Ensuring Success for All: Tools and Practices for Inclusive Schools,"Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Counseling",Harvard Graduate School of Education,"Monday, April 9, 2018","Sunday, April 22, 2018",Online,"Understand how educators create inclusive school settings that make success possible for all students.

Overview
Why is it important to have inclusive schools? How can students, teachers, and school leaders view this diversity as beneficial for their own learning and the school as a whole?

Ensuring Success for All is an online professional development program for teachers and administrators in K-12 settings. Based upon the research of HGSE Professor Thomas Hehir, a leading international expert on educating students with disabilities, the workshop explores why inclusion matters and how schools can treat diversity as an asset. Participants will explore current research on creating inclusive classrooms as well as the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework. They will look at examples of UDL in practice, including tools that can be leveraged to identify barriers to learning and ensure success for all students.

Program Details
This two-week online workshop includes a mix of self-paced learning, group discussion, and job-embedded application. Activities include:

Video lectures from Professor Hehir
Research summaries and assigned readings
Self-assessment and reflection prompts
Facilitated cohort discussions
Job-embedded practice where you will apply the concepts and techniques learned*
A core part of the HGSE experience is cohort learning, and this curriculum is designed to create a community of practice for participants to learn with and from each other.

The online workshop will require a total of 5-7 hours of work. Participants who complete all individual assessments and contribute to group discussions will receive a certificate indicating completion of five clock hours of instruction.

*Note: all content is self-paced, including group discussions. Facilitators will moderate discussion boards throughout the two-week program.",https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ppe/program/ensuring-success-all-tools-and-practices-inclusive-schools,,

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. 
 
With lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.
 
Our communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can‚Äôt experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.
 
At the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. 
 
We come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism‚Äîabout white supremacy‚Äîaffirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. 
 
We know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. 
 
We celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn‚Äôt want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations‚Äîour art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.
 
Come home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities‚Äîto build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don‚Äôt all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  
 
We hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom.",https://clpp.hampshire.edu/conference/2018-conference,,

Scientific research has found that stress, anxiety and behavior problems in children can affect the structure of the brain and reduce learning and motivation. Yet stress and behavior problems are on the rise in schools. An APA ""Stress in America"" Study found that overall stress levels in adults in 2017 has increased for the first time in 10 years, with more than two-thirds being stressed, and millennials with higher stress levels than any other group; and the APA's 2014 report found that 27 percent of teens experience ""extreme stress"" during school. A 2016 report by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that 46 percent of teachers feel high daily stress. And in a recent Teaching Tolerance survey of 10,000 educators, 9 in 10 of them reported that since the election, there has been a negative affect on student mood and behavior and that anxiety, harassment, fights and insults in schools have increase dramatically.  

However, new cognitive, social and biological sciences may hold the answers to reducing stress, anxiety and behavior problems to students and teachers. Research has found that both negative and positive emotions, mindfulness meditation, promoting emotional agility, personality traits, and classroom management all affect the brain and mood and can all be used to significantly reduce stress and increase academic achievement.  Learn about the ""Science of Stress, Emotions, and Behavior""; the impact of anxiety, emotions, and behavior on the brain and achievement; how to manage behavior problems in students; strategies to reduce social, test and performance anxiety; how teachers can do more with less time and overcome burnout and the feeling of being overwhelmed, and the benefits of mindfulness for students, teachers and administrators.

Unsurprisingly, there has also been an increase in articles with headlines like ‚Äú4 Tips to Teach Kindness,‚Äù ‚ÄúCreating Equitable and Just Classrooms‚Äù and ‚ÄúTalking About Tolerance.‚Äù 

By definition, a classroom is a space where ‚Äústudents gather collectively‚Äù‚Äîa place where many different individuals come together to form a learning community. As teachers, how this learning community works is largely based on the culture we create in our own classrooms. As the world outside the classroom becomes increasingly complex, how do we create genuinely safe learning environments where all student experience is valued and respected?
 
This year‚Äôs annual conference provides an opportunity for us to think and write together to investigate and grapple with issues around difference and equity in the classroom. More specifically, we‚Äôll focus on how writing-based teaching strategies can help foster the kinds of safe and creative spaces that students thrive in. How might informal writing and active listening help to create an atmosphere of inclusion? Given the evolving terminologies associated with identity, how can we make sure to be attentive to the language we use and promote?

Whereas once the norm was teacher-focused, sage-on-the-stage, a shift is still going on that places the learner at the core of the learning experience.  Driven by the wide adoption of design thinking and user experience processes, LX pushes to make sure the learner voice is integrated more purposefully by sharing the experience development and iteration process with those for whom it is designed.

From an emphasis on scaffolding and creating software with Learner Centered Design to the wide adoption of design thinking and user experience processes with Learning Experience (LX) Design the goal continues to be to create effective and meaningful experiences for the learner.  ELDc18 seeks to bring together diverse voices and innovative approaches to designing with the learner in mind.

The following topics are examples, but are in no way exhaustive or limited:

How might learners be involved in the design and evaluation of learning experiences?
What are examples of personalized learning and what can we learn from these experiments?
How can we use learning analytics to better understand aspects of learning experiences?
What are some organizational approaches to incorporating user experience research and iteration into the design process?",http://eld.montclair.edu/,,

Many have developed standing committees on diversity and begun to recruit a diverse faculty, while others have also established diversity leadership positions. Despite taking these steps, schools often find themselves unable to sustain their original achievements or to make further progress toward their goals.

A highly experienced team of independent school professionals, who have
successfully created inclusive communities, established diversity programs and applied multicultural teaching practices in their individual schools, as well as having spent over 20 years assisting other independent schools nationwide, provide the leadership of the Diversity Directions Independant School Seminar.

Deeper Learning for All: From the Classroom to the System,Pedagogy,Harvard Graduate School of Education,"Monday, July 9, 2018","Thursday, July 12, 2018","Cambridge, MA","Experience and learn how to create the conditions for deep and powerful learning that prepares all students for the demands of the 21st century.

""One of the most powerful things you can do is give adults models and experiences that mirror what you are hoping they will do for students.‚Äù ‚Äî Jal Mehta, Faculty Chair

Overview
Today's adults need far more than the basic academic knowledge and skills that have dominated classroom instruction for decades. They must be able to tackle open-ended problems in critical, creative, and collaborative ways and to quickly learn new skills as job markets change. But what kinds of experiences produce such powerful habits of learning, and how can we ensure that all learners have access to these experiences?

In Deeper Learning for All, participants will rethink old paradigms and consider what it will take to design a new a 21st-century system that promotes deeper, more engaging instruction for all students. They will look at the conditions educators need to generate deeper learning in classrooms and the changes required at all levels of the system to make such learning possible.

Program Details
In this four-day program, you will experience deep learning in a variety of settings, assess your current instructional practice, reflect on the obstacles that may inhibit deeper learning, and develop a plan to implement in your own classroom, school, or setting.

This highly interactive on-campus program will unfold in three parts:

Experiential Learning: The first part of this on-campus program is about experiencing powerful learning and reflecting upon what makes learning deep. You will experience a variety of out-of-school learning environments, participate in a deeper learning class with a K-12 teacher in your discipline, and do an extended workshop with Ron Berger, Chief Academic Officer at EL Education, on deeper learning beyond project based learning.
Structural Change: During the second portion of this on-campus program, you will reflect on what produces powerful learning for the students and adults with whom you work, understand what structural changes are required in your context to create those conditions, and leverage design principles to formulate a plan of action you can implement with your team.
The Change Process: During the third portion of this program, you will examine issues that may be especially useful as you manage the change process, including workshops on how to get unstuck, how to move from technical to adaptive change, how to build brave communities that honestly address issues of race, and how to do whole school redesign for deeper learning.

Overview
Making sense of data is critical, but so too is the process for ensuring this data impacts teaching and learning. Data Wise provides the tools and protocols to enable you and your colleagues to engage in an effective collaborative process around data.

The Data Wise Improvement Process provides a clear, carefully tested blueprint that teachers, school leaders, and system-level leaders can use to examine a wide range of data and catalyze conversations that drive instructional improvement. The Data Wise Leadership Institute prepares teams to plan a thoughtful launch of this inquiry process in their own settings.

Program Details
During this intensive week on Harvard‚Äôs campus your school or system-level team will work with a dedicated facilitator and peers from diverse settings who are similarly committed to learning how to lead collaborative inquiry. The intensive course will get your team energized as you learn the Data Wise process and work on developing three essential habits: shared commitment to action, intentional collaboration, and a relentless focus on evidence.Note: The June institute addresses the same objectives as the January program but includes additional faculty presentations and in-class time for teams to meet with a dedicated coach for discussion.

We strongly recommend that teams also enroll in the Data Wise in Action Program, where you will receive four months of continued support from a dedicated Data Wise coach as you implement the inquiry process in your own school or system. Teams applying for both programs will be given preference during the admissions process and participants in the leadership institute receive a discount for the Data Wise In Action Program in the same calendar year.

Overview
How can we prepare our students to be engaged global citizens? What is global competence and how can we cultivate it in our students? How can we make the case for global education in schools?

Educating Global Citizens, an online professional development program for K-12 teachers, instructional coaches, and school leaders, begins with an introduction to global education. Professor Reimers and other specialists then focus the conversation on global competence, what it is and why it is important. Participants will identify barriers to global education in their context and will learn from examples of schools already incorporating global competence in K-12 systems. Finally, participants will explore strategies for advancing global education, building a toolkit to inform their future work.

The program is a mix of self-paced learning, facilitated group discussion, and job-embedded learning that will help educators understand, advocate for, and implement strategies for global competence with their students. Participants will learn tools and tips from the online lessons that they can weave directly into practice in their classrooms or schools.

Program Details
This two-week online workshop includes a mix of self-paced learning, group discussion, and job-embedded application. Activities include:

Video lectures from from Fernando Reimers and other experts on global education
Research summaries and assigned readings
Self-assessment and reflection prompts
Facilitated cohort discussions
Job-embedded practice, where you will apply the concepts and techniques learned*
A core part of the HGSE experience is cohort learning, and this curriculum is designed to create a community of practice for participants to learn with and from each other.

As of 2017, nearly 52% of the world‚Äôs population are considered Internet users, with tens of millions more joining their ranks each year. Seventy percent of these users are youth, yet 94% of youth in developed countries are routinely online compared to only 30% in the least developed countries.2 But while more than half of the world‚Äôs population is online, how connected are we really? What kind of connections are being nurtured in the online space? And how equitable is people‚Äôs access to the Internet around the globe? How does this lack of equity impact our ability to connect to others globally?

The internet doesn‚Äôt just connect people; it is present in seemingly every facet of our lives in big and small ways. It is woven into financial transactions, government functions, the way we learn and access information, how we entertain ourselves, and increasingly in things themselves (appliances, transportation devices, even children‚Äôs toys). These connections make our lives easier in many ways, but they also make us vulnerable to both natural and man-made challenges (not to mention what should be, could be and actually is done with the data that is collected through these networks). We all hold a variety of ideas about the web‚Äôs promises and perils. The goal of the 2018 summer workshop for educators will be to investigate and make sense of these challenges--and opportunities--as a learning community, and to consider how best to examine them with students who are growing up as digital natives.

Throughout the summer workshop, we will focus on the Internet as a global phenomenon. We will include the US in the discussion (especially as a means of understanding our own perspectives and as a point of comparison), but will focus more broadly on global patterns and trends to enrich and expand our understanding beyond the American viewpoint. As a learning community, we will pay special attention to investigating both the benefits and costs of connectivity on a global/societal, community and individual level. We will examine how and why the web affects different groups and people differently, reflecting specifically on how the Internet reduces or increases equity gaps. We‚Äôll consider the ways the Internet makes our lives easier and at what cost.

Learning Environments for Tomorrow: Next Practices for Educators and Architects,Pedagogy,Harvard Graduate School of Education,"Tuesday, October 2, 2018","Thursday, October 4, 2018","Cambridge, MA","Collaborate with architects and educators from around the world to apply principles of effective pedagogy and design to physical learning environment projects.

Overview
Physical spaces have an enormous impact on learners‚Äô experiences. Building layouts can create opportunities for new relationships among students, staff, and the community. Furniture arrangements in classrooms and hallways can foster planned collaboration and spontaneous informal learning among students. Day-lighting, learning commons, and natural materials can create a sense of place and connection.

Whether we‚Äôre engaged in small-scale classroom remodeling or large-scale school planning, effective designs are based on clear sense of learners‚Äô needs and educational goals. How can we understand the needs of the learners and the community for whom we are designing? What are the educational goals that should inform effective designs? And how can we plan and prototype solutions so they can evolve as needs and goals change over time?

Participants learn from educational and design leaders about emerging trends shaping today and tomorrow‚Äôs educational environments such as ubiquitous technologies, personalized learning, sustainable construction, and collaboration. Working in team-based design studios, participants apply the program content by engaging in a design process that spans five areas: the needs of people, design principles, program goals, plans, and prototypes. The program offers content and a process that participants can apply and bring back to their settings.  

Program Details
In this three-day collaborative program, you and your team will explore themes that inform 21st-century school design, such as collaboration, technology, engagement, and sustainability. You will take part in interactive plenary sessions given by leaders in the field of education and architecture, topic-specific workshops led by innovative practitioners and thinkers, guided site visits to provocative learning environments in the Boston-area, and a ‚Äúdesign studio,‚Äù facilitated by experts in collaborative design processes. 

Each component is crafted to create opportunities for your team to consider the needs and values of your learners, the forward-looking educational goals for your community, and the qualities of the spaces that can support such needs and goals. Participants will have the opportunity to focus on a specific school design project they are currently involved in, or to work more abstractly within their design teams. Design studios will offer daily opportunities to get feedback on your plans and future prototyping can support the educational experiences for your community.

Fellows work closely with the staff at the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington as they research and produce work to be distributed to a national audience.

The Life Guard Teacher Fellowships will support the creation or dramatic transformation of curriculum materials, lesson plans, website content, interpretive tools, or other education resources to support a 21st-century classroom‚Äôs needs. The subject of said materials must relate to teaching about George Washington and the founding era. Four to six fellowships will be awarded during the 2017-18 cycle. 

Successful applications will demonstrate knowledge of curriculum connections to George Washington and the founding era; the ability to integrate the material with national and state-based models for student assessment and standards; and will make use of Mount Vernon‚Äôs existing online and onsite expertise and resources. The proposed project should show both creativity and practicality so that it pushes innovation and also can be adopted in a variety of classroom environments.  

Fellowships awarded are for one to three weeks of consecutive or non-consecutive study between June 2017 and August 2018.

Selected fellows will work with Mount Vernon staff to schedule dates for residency. Reimbursement for one round trip to the Washington Library, housing, and a $1000 stipend for each week of research at the Library are also included in the Fellowship.

WMWP Summer Leadership Institute,"Pedagogy, School Design, Leadership, Humanities",Western Massachusetts Writing Project,Summer 2018,,"Amherst, MA","WMWP's annual Summer Leadership Institute brings together outstanding teachers who work with students in all academic content areas and at all grade levels, pre‚ÄëK through college. Supported by the WMWP facilitators and each other, these teachers spend three weeks immersed in writing, reading, and reflective inquiry.

During the following school year, they conduct action-research projects in their own classrooms and come together for three reunion meetings. At the end of this process, they become WMWP Teacher-Consultants. In this capacity they may provide professional development to schools for WMWP; present their research in local, regional, and national venues; and contribute to the ongoing growth of WMWP.

In this way, the Summer Leadership Institute represents the first leg in what thousands of National Writing Project teachers around the country have described as a career-transforming journey.

As participants, teachers engage in their own writing in order to explore ways to use writing more meaningfully in their classrooms. They participate in a collaborative inquiry community: reading current theory and research, engaging in classroom-based action research, and presenting a professional workshop. Inquiry focuses on the following themes:

CLASSROOM INQUIRY: How can reflecting on my teaching help me ask meaningful questions to improve my practice?

REFLECTION AND IMPLEMENTATION: How do I incorporate change into my practice? How can attention to difference in my classroom inform my pedagogy and/or curriculum?

LANGUAGE AND POWER: How can language be used in a classroom to empower or disempower students? How can a student's native language be valued in my classroom?

LITERACY AND LEARNING: How can I help students become more confident and effective writers and readers? What writing-to-learn and critical reading strategies can I use to help students develop content knowledge and understanding?",https://www.umass.edu/wmwp/wmwp-summer-leadership-institute,,

Students may attend Bread Loaf for one or more summers and take courses in continuing graduate education, or they may enroll in full degree programs, leading to the Master of Arts and Master of Letters degrees in English.
